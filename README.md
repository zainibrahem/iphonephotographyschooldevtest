Here is my submission of the test. However, I would like to apologize for not noticing the need for commit messages throughout the progress until it was too late. Thank you for your understanding.

You might find the way I approached the test unique. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

Please be aware that I was not able to start the test immediately due to the moving process I am currently undergoing for my new home.

I hope you appreciate my thought process and recognize the abilities I can bring to the company and the team.

Please don't forget to migrate the database using the command: php artisan migrate.
Feel free to test the application with the command: php artisan test.

I look forward to hearing from you, regardless of the results.

Thank you.
